## Gravity Hookah Ventilator

This folder contains the design files and firmware for the Gravity Hookah Ventilator. You can find the instructions to build this product at <http://pandemiccookbook.org/critical_care/respiratory_care/ventilators/gravity_hookah_ventilator/>.

### Firmware

The best way to program the firmware is using the mbed IDE at <https://os.mbed.com/studio/>. You can find the firmware at <https://os.mbed.com/users/kabukistarship/code/gravity_hookah_ventilator>, where you can also import it into the mbed web-based IDE. We are in need of a Contributor to port the mbed code to Arduino.

## How to Contribute
