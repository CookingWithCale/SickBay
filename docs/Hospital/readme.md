## Pandemic Hospitals

 When pandemics break out people will start panic shopping to buy enough supplies and food and toilet paper will disappear, our healthcare system will be quickly overwhelmed and medical supplies will dry up, and we will have to rapidly build ***Pandemic Hospitals*** using off the shelf and 3D printed parts and rapid prototyping and manufacturing. Pandemic Hospitals are generally located in a centralized place in a city where you can fit hundreds to thousands of people. People will be advised to stay at home unless they require hospitalization, at which time you'll have to get transported to the Pandemic hospital.

 At the Pandemic Hospital you can expect to have one section for critical patients who are near death and require immediate use of medical resources, and another section for Stable patients who are not near death and require immediate use of medical resources. If there is a hospital nearby, the most critical patients likely will be served there because they have the best resources, so patients are monitored at Pandemic hospitals to transfer them up to more intensive care as soon as possible. Infections from diseases other than the Pandemic disease are also highly likely to spread at Pandemic Hospitals, so care must be taken to limit contamination and inter-personal contact.
