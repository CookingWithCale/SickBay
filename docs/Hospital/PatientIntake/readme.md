## Patient Intake

Patients coming into the Pandemic Hospital need to be prioritized in importance of how close they are to tiring out. Those who are only having trouble breathing need to go to the back of the line, and those who are closest to death are to go to the front of the line.

This chapter is the essential information you need to know to taking in, or being brought into a Pandemic Hospital yourself. We are in need of a contributor to write this section. Please see the [Contributing Guide](https://pandemiccookbook.org/docs/contributing).
