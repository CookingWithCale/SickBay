### Contributing Guide

### C++ Style Guide

The style guide we're using is the Google C++ Style Guide that can be found at <https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html>.

### Easiest Way to Contribute

The easiest way for you to contribute is using a GitHub Issue Ticket at <https://github.com/KabukiStarship/sickbay/issues>. For the title, enter a one-sentence mission statement of what you want us to do. Then enter in the Description a more detailed Problem and Solution statement of what it is that you're contributing, if what you want us to do is not obvious from the Title Mission Statement.

## Development Environment

Our primary development is for mbed using Arduino pin outs to make porting to Arduino as simple as possible. mbed has an online IDE so there is no need to setup an IDE, we don't have a walk through for you but feel free to contribute one via a GitHub Issue ticket. We are in need of someone to take over the Arduino ports; we need all the hardware we can get our hands on.

**1.** Sign up for a GitHub account at <https://github.com>.

**2.** Download Git for your Operating System at <https://git-scm.com/>.

**3.** Learn the Git Revision Control System at <https://try.github.io>.

**4.** There are two repositories, one for the Pandemic Cookbook and another for the SickBay, which contains the design files. Fork both Git repositories (AKA repos) into your own account (See <https://try.github.io> for instructions on forking) so you can make and save changes and initiate Pull Requests to merge your contributions with the master branch. The repos are located at:

* <https://github.com/CookingWithCale/pandemic.cookbook>
* <https://github.com/KabukiStarship/sickbay>

**5** Clone the Cookbook repos:

git clone https://github.com/CookingWithCale/pandemic.cookbook.git
git clone https://github.com/KabukiStarship/sickbay.git
```

**6.** Download and install the latest version of FreeCAD, a really nice free Solid modeling program, at <https://www.freecadweb.org/>.

**7.** Download and install mbed studio at <https://os.mbed.com/studio/>.

```Bash
git branch -m Issue123 Issue124
```

**2.** Complete the issue with passing unit tests and submit the completed issue:

```BASH
