## Coding Standards

### Style Guide

I'm a C++ programmer who is used to the ASCII C++ Style Guide, which is a modified Google C++ Style Guide, the biggest difference is that constants start with c rather than k, because there is no k in constant and I never took the math class those guys took where they're using k, we used c like a sane person; but ASCII Python isn't out yet. The community is in control the Style Guide.

### Metric Units

1. All code shall be stored internally using standard base metric units; meaning store in Meters, Grams, Liters, etc.

### Doxygen Tags

1. Doxygen tags shall be used minimally to ensure the system operates more safely to protect from death and injury.
