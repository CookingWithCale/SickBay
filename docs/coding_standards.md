## Coding Standards

### Style Guide

This style guide is designed to be easier to read out loud. If you want someone to memorize a web address, it's best not to have any spaces or underscores.

1. All member names shall be UpperSnakeCase; if we only had one to use this would be the one we would probably all pick because people rarely say underscore when they talk.
1. All variable names shall be lower_case_camel.
1. Tabs shall be 2 spaces wide.
1. The standard metric base units used shall be Seconds, Centimeters, Kilograms, Milliliters.
1. Doxygen tags shall be used minimally to ensure the system operates more safely to protect from death and injury; this is here with the warning that bug are easily hidden by noisy Doxygen tags and easily hidden without.
