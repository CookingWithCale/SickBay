## Gravity Hookah Ventilator

The Gravity Hookah Ventilator, GHVentilator, or GHV is an ultra-low-cost rapidly-manufacturable Respiratory Ventilator that can be created from a Home Improvement and electronics hobby store. The GHV firmware currently only works for mbed but it can quickly be ported to Arduino and we're seeking volunteers to take that over. The GHV is controlled using Kabuki Starship SickBay, which is a Python app that allows you to interface asynchronously with mbed RPC (and Arduino coming soon) using a standard Serial or I2C connection allowing one Laptop to control multiple SickBay hardware units and view stats using the Console and coming soon via a static web app.

## How to Contribute

The best way to learn how to contribute to SickBay is to read the Quickstart Guide of the Pandemic Cookbook at <https://pandemiccookbook.org/getting_started/quickstart_guide>.
