## Pandemic Ventilators

A ventilator is a type of Respirator with higher concentrations of oxygen, between 50% to 100%, that allows patients to breathe while they are awake and incapacitated. Most patients will show up to the pandemic hospital having troubles or completely unable to breathe and will need to be immediately put onto a Ventilator.

In a pandemic there will be a shortage of ventilators requiring people to creating Do-It-Yourself (DIY) ventilators called Pandemic Ventilators. It's best not to try to come up with a new design but to make a currently existing one. Since we have very little time you must order any parts from online now. In this section were going to cover the most popular DIY designs in order that they are most likely to be able to be made from commonly available parts at Home Depot and Amazon by an unskilled maker.
